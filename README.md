# Bellybutton Biodiversity

***Overview***

On this module I was asked to build an interactive dashboard using Plotly.js to explore data on the biodiversity of bellybuttons from people across the country and then deploy it to a cloud server in order for both the research participants, who identity remain anonymous, and fellow researches will be able to access. Those who participated on the study will be able to visit the website and select their ID numbers to see what bacterial species live in their bellybuttons.

Using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, I had to resolved the following tasks:

1- Create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.

2- Create a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:
- The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
- The sample_values as the y-axis values.
- The sample_values as the marker size.
- The otu_ids as the marker colors.
- The otu_labels as the hover-text values.

3- Create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
